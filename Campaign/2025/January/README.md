# OpenSourceSauce January 2025 Campaign

From January 2025, the OSS Campaign will start.

## What to do

Any repositories created before 2025 January 1 12:00 AM that are aimed for the OSS Campaign will not be accepted. You may start coding before the time.
Create a new repository with the prefixes oss. or opensourcesauce. followed by your repository name and the date of creation.

```bash
oss.{REPOSITORY-NAME}.{DAY(dd)}
```

OR

```bash
opensourcesauce.{REPOSITORY-NAME}.{DAY(dd)}
```

FOR EXAMPLE,

oss.CoolTool.04
```

AND
