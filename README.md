## Overview

OpenSourceSauce is a GitHub Campaign to maximise the amount of useful things that are open-source on GitHub. Many big companies, use GitHub only to distribute the packages, deployments or installers but no source code. They do not understand that GitHub is a place where everyone can upload anything to the internet. No matter the size, no matter the amount, GitHub just stores it. Yes, in GitHub, anyone can do anything but it is just that amount of proper for big companies to upload their source code along with their packages. To ensure that this act does not happen again, we have launched this campaign.
